# Weekly Project 1 - Code a game!

## Rules of my game

The rules of Hangman are very simple. You choose a word and others have to guess letters until they know what word it is. For each wrong guess one mark has to be drawn. If all the marks of the Hangman have been drawn before the word has been guessed, the host wins. If the word is guessed before this happens, the player that guessed the word wins.

To make this program simpler I have decided to first try with one letter isntead of a word.

## Features
- The "Host" player will be able to introduce a letter of his/her choice.
- The program will be able to ask players for letters until either they have found what letter it was or they have lost the game because all the marks have been "drawn".
- The program has to be able to inform the player how the game is going until it finishes.

## Ideas for feature versions
- The host can input words.
- The host can input phrases.
- The host can be the machine
- The players can input number of players and names, and this info is used to give context.
- There is a version for kids.
- The machine draws the hangman instead of giving the info written.
- The players can use speech recognition as an input.
